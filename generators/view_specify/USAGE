Description:
    Auto-generate RSpec view specs by interrogating your existing views. You
    can add extra template stubs, if you need. Current limitation: you have to
    add the --force option for subsequent runs.

Example:
    ./script/generate view_specify [--stubs=stub1,stub2,stub3]

    This will create:
        spec/views/[each_view_dir]/[each_view]
